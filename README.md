# PWC_Job_Simulation
PwC Switzerland's Power BI job simulation, enhancing skills in data visualization and client understanding. Developed dynamic Power BI dashboards to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and provided data-driven insights tailored to client needs. 

### Call Centre 
Project Overview
This is a Power BI dashboard for a call center to provide actionable insights into key performance metrics. The dashboard visualized critical KPIs such as overall customer satisfaction, total calls answered versus abandoned, and call trends over time. It also showcased the average speed of answer to monitor responsiveness and an agent performance quadrant that compared average handle time (talk duration) with the number of calls answered. This interactive dashboard enabled the call center manager to easily identify long-term trends in customer and agent behavior, helping inform strategic decisions to improve overall efficiency and service quality.
