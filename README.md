# PWC_Job_Simulation
PwC Switzerland's Power BI job simulation, enhancing skills in data visualization and client understanding. Developed dynamic Power BI dashboards to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and provided data-driven insights tailored to client needs. 

### Call Centre 
Project Overview :

This is Power BI dashboard for a call center to provide actionable insights into key performance metrics. The dashboard visualized critical KPIs such as overall customer satisfaction, total calls answered versus abandoned, and call trends over time. It also showcased the average speed of answer to monitor responsiveness and an agent performance quadrant that compared average handle time (talk duration) with the number of calls answered. This interactive dashboard enabled the call center manager to easily identify long-term trends in customer and agent behavior, helping inform strategic decisions to improve overall efficiency and service quality.

### Customer Retention
Project Overview :

Developed a Power BI dashboard focused on customer retention and risk analysis by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer demographics, services subscribed, account information, contract types, payment methods, and contract periods. The dashboard provided insights into customer behaviour, highlighting retention risks and patterns across different segments. By analyzing this data, the dashboard helped identify high-risk customers, track service engagement, and evaluate contract renewals, offering actionable recommendations to improve customer retention and optimize service offerings based on comprehensive data analysis.
